# Binary Image Classification from Scratch

This project implements a binary image classifier from scratch using only NumPy, covering fundamental concepts of neural networks and deep learning.

## Description

A comprehensive implementation of neural networks for binary and multiclass classification tasks. The project builds all components from the ground up, including forward propagation, backpropagation, various activation functions, and optimization techniques.

## Learning Objectives

- Build neural networks from scratch using NumPy
- Understand and implement forward and backward propagation
- Implement various activation functions (Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Softmax)
- Understand loss functions and gradient descent
- Implement multiclass classification
- Work with one-hot encoding
- Optimize neural networks using vectorization

## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- NumPy 1.15
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- pycodestyle 2.4

## Project Structure

This directory contains implementations of:
- Neuron class for binary classification
- Neural network architectures
- Deep neural networks
- Activation functions
- Cost and loss functions
- Forward and backward propagation
- Model training and evaluation
- Model persistence using pickle

## Usage

All matrix multiplications use `numpy.matmul`. Code follows vectorization principles without explicit loops where possible.
